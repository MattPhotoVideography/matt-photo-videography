To tell the truth it was a little suspiciously (I’m not used to get presents like this!).\nThen I was surprised even more, when Matt came! With all the requisite, lights, equipment… just in time! With all instructions! Explained me everything, won over me and the main model of the shoot - two-month-old V. Michelle:)).\nWe did a great job together! Despite the fact that the model's patience ran out very quickly))), we managed to take many wonderful pictures! Appreciate to Matt, my recommendation.",
