Choosing a calm, prepared session is the secret to dreamy newborn photos. Here’s a simple plan we share with families across **Edmonton, Calgary, and Red Deer**.

## When to book
- **Best window:** 5–14 days after birth. Babies are sleepiest and curl naturally.
- **Due-date booking:** Reserve in your 2nd–3rd trimester; we’ll float the date and lock a time after baby arrives.
- **Studio vs in-home:** Studio gives consistent light and backdrops; in-home feels personal and easy on new parents. We bring safe props, wraps, heat, and sanitation supplies either way (comfort and safety always come first). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Week-by-week prep
**Two weeks before**  
- Share your **must-have shots** (siblings, parents, heirlooms).  
- Pick a color palette (soft neutrals photograph beautifully).

**One week before**  
- Confirm feeding patterns and preferred start time.  
- Gather **outfits/wraps**; avoid bold logos or loud patterns that pull the eye from baby. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

**48 hours before**  
- Keep baby’s nails trimmed; set aside a simple onesie, pacifier, extra diapers/wipes.  
- If siblings are joining, choose **coordinating**, not matching, outfits. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**Session day**  
- **Warm room + full tummy** = relaxed baby. We’ll guide you through gentle posing that’s comfortable and secure. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Parents: soft, solid tops; avoid bright neons. Natural makeup and tidy hair always photograph best. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## What we handle
- Temperature, clean fabrics, safe posing, and soothing.  
- Lighting/backdrops to flatter baby’s skin and keep color true. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Favorite keepsakes to bring
- A blanket knitted by family, a hospital hat, or a tiny name card—small items make the gallery feel uniquely yours. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
