Your gallery should feel like **your family**, not a template. Try one or two of these simple ideas for sessions in **Edmonton, Calgary, or Red Deer**.

1) **Choose a meaningful location**  
Your favorite river-valley trail, the neighborhood rink, or the backyard you planted together adds instant story. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

2) **Bring one personal item per child**  
A beloved stuffed animal or soccer ball relaxes kids and creates real smiles. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

3) **Plan a mini-activity**  
Hot chocolate picnic, leaf-toss, or baking cookies at home—movement gives us candid, connected frames.

4) **Write a 1-line “about us”**  
Share a sentence about your family (e.g., “We read bedtime stories every night”). We’ll aim to capture it visually.

5) **Coordinate outfits around your home décor**  
If the photos will hang in a warm, neutral living room, choose complementary tones so wall art feels intentional. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

6) **Include heirlooms**  
A quilt, a locket, a handmade sweater—tiny details make big memories. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

7) **Bring music**  
A portable speaker with a favorite playlist keeps energy up and helps little ones relax.
