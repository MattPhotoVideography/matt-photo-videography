Great outfits should make **you** the focus—not the clothes. Use these simple rules for sessions around **Edmonton, Calgary, and Red Deer**.

## Start with a palette
Pick **2–3 base colors + 1 accent** (e.g., oatmeal, soft blue, charcoal + warm tan). Neutrals flatter skin tones and keep the gallery timeless. Avoid loud logos and ultra-busy patterns that pull attention from faces.

## Coordinate, don’t match
Think “cousins of a color,” not identical shirts. Mix textures (knits, linen, denim) so the group looks styled, not uniform.

## Fit and comfort beat trends
Well-fitting pieces photograph cleaner than oversized or stiff garments. Choose clothes you can move in—natural interactions always look best.

## Easy outfit formulas
- **Park sessions:** Midi dress + cardigan; chinos + knit; kids in simple knits/sneakers.  
- **Urban / modern:** Dark denim, a leather or structured coat, monochrome layers.  
- **Studio neutrals:** Soft beiges/creams; bare feet for little ones—gorgeous and timeless.

## Hair, makeup, and small details
Natural makeup with light powder to reduce shine; tame flyaways; remove bulky items from pockets; choose subtle jewelry that won’t date.

## Personal touches
Bring a small heirloom blanket, a favorite book, or a meaningful toy to weave your family’s story into the session.
